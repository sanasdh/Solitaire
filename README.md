# Solitaire

## Description
The goal of this game is to make 4 foundation part ( 1 per suit) from Ace to King. Player can only move the faced-up cards and locate them:
1)underneath another card if the other card is (adding an event listener with “click”):
	1.1) different color (black or red)
	1.2) one number higher
2) if the selected card is Ace, then the player can move it to one of the 4 empty spots at the top, after that if card 2 of the same suit is faced up (and there isn’t any card under it), the player can move it on top of Ace, and so on….
After moving the card, the player can flip the face down card and use it. If a column gets empty, only a king card can fill it.
The player can flip one card at the time from the piles of card on the top left corner, and use it like a normal faced up card.
